It only has 43;000 miles on it and has hundreds of thousands of miles ahead of itself and is a great option for anyone interested in Tacomas or just a sturdy reliable vehicle. I'm selling this as I am investing more of my money into other hobbies and I am also looking to get into an old 4Runner; Landcruiser or Sequoia.  The truck is stock and has had regular maintenance conducted. Weather Tech Mats are installed and included and have made a huge difference in preserving the vehicle. The title is Clean and the truck has not been in any Car Accidents. It does has signs of use like small scratches and dents however they are small and the Cement Gray body color helps reduce their visibility.  Looking for $35;000 or a Trade w/Cash for a late 1990s or early 2000s 4Runner; Landcruiser or Sequoia.   If interested please email me and we can arrange a test drive and/or inspection. Looking for Check in which we would go to your bank to ensure it clears. No Payment Plans will be accepted."";;al;32.6013;-85.443974;2021-05-03T12:12:59-0500";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The good: engines only got 97;000 miles on it; runs strong; shifts great; steerings tight; has new plugs; wires; and coil pack; good tires (bought new a few years ago and have put low miles on them); and interior is in great shape.   The bad: its a northeast car and has rust on the rear wheel wells and underside of the car; has typical dings and scratches for a car this old; exhaust is rusted and will need to be replaced (muffler is supported on one side by tie wire); brakes are very soft and needs pads and rotors all the way around (particularly the rear which have started to grind); ABS light recently came on; check engine light throws a minor evap leak code; CD stuck in the CD player; has developed a passive electricity drain (if it sits for a few weeks it may need to be jump started but doesn't happen when driven daily); and it leaks oil (most likely from the valve cover gaskets) onto the exhaust; which results in under hood smoke. Theres an open recall on the passenger air bag; I've tried numerous times to get the Subaru dealer in Columbus to replace this; but they always have an excuse for why the can't do it or say they'll call with an appointment and never do and I stopped trying once it was no longer my daily driver.  It books for $3600 in fair condition; but considering the work it needs am asking $2100 or best offer. The car was a reliable daily driver for me for 5 years and could continue to be with a new exhaust; pads and rotors; and valve cover gaskets. It could also be a great parts car for someone looking for a good engine; transmission; and seats."";;al;32.5475;-85.4682;2021-04-20T09:55:48-0500";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The F-Series was born with the vision of satisfying the average American ??s need for a utility vehicle with daily driver comforts.  I rebuilt this beauty with the help of a few specialists. The chrome and bright work has been revitalized to reflective perfection. Skins bear clean and stylish whitewalls that circle classic and original hub caps. Mostly stock; the interior was completely refurbished during the restoration in black and gray. Gauges were modified to incorporate an electronic Dakota cluster; retaining the dash and classic look. Shifting remains as the  ??three on the tree ?? setup. 1954 was the first year of Ford ??s entry into the over-head valve world with its  ??Y ?? block 239. Believed to be numbers matching and thus original; the motor has gone through a complete rebuild and tasteful modifications include a 4 bbl. Carb. Drivability was improved with modified electric power steering. Electrical system was upgraded to incorporating an alternator and 12V wiring throughout. This is no Trailer Queen but she does have a crown; or should I say; crowning achievement as the Best in Class. And the drive and award was repeated in 2016.  $27;000.00 or best offer  If you have any other questions please feel free to reach out.   -Zack"";;al;33.5363;-87.051;2021-05-03T13:18:33-0500";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Triple Black Car with  20 options ordered special by the Chief of Police in Homewood Alabama for his personal duty car. Fresh Black paint in great shape. The car was always an unmarked car. Locals called it the """"Bat Car"""".      9C1 being the designation for the Police Car which is most common as 4 door sedans and ordered thru the Fleet System of GM. This car being a Two Door coupe with the 350 High Performance V8 and HD Turbo 350 transmission and Positraction rear end. Car has the optional 120MPH speedo; AC; Full dash instrumentation; power steering and Brakes.  This car was ordered under the COPO designation by the Cheif himself. As the Chiefs car it was well maintained and never wrecked. High back special bucket seats are much different than the civilian version. 350 V8 was only available in Police cars.      I have only seen one other 9C1 two door and it was a race car; stripped of the original equipment and with no Factory Documentation like the original Build sheet; window sticker and factory invoice from Chevrolet Historic Department. I also have three copies of the Original Build Sheet.      2018 I participated in the HOT ROD Power tour with this car. Chevy never built a Malibu SS in 1979 but if they did; it would look like this car. Drive it anywhere!      I can guarentee you will not see one of these at any car show. G Bodies are just cool!
